I've gotta be honest here, this project is probably garbage. XD

This is merely an Arch Linux install script I'm working on for myself to get my setup easily if need be, I have no experience with such things so quality will more than likely be subpar.

I'm probably pulling far more packages than I need to so this will be quite bloated, I'll work on that later.
